## Contents

- **Transcripts**  
  Text transcripts from experiments across GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Gemma models.  
  Some are complete and polished; others are raw logs.  

- **Videos**  
  Original screen recordings of certain sessions.  
  ⚠️ Some videos have no transcripts yet.  

- **Transcript-only sessions**  
  In some cases, no video was recorded — only transcripts remain.

## Transparency Note

This repository is intentionally a **raw evidence dump**:  
- Some sessions include both video + transcript.  
- Some are transcript-only.  
- Some are video-only.  

The aim is **maximum transparency and reproducibility** — everything collected during the project is made available, even if incomplete.
